# MiniDES
The simulator MiniDES is a lightweight framework to run discrete simulations of resource objects in Python. It allows for synchronized time progress on arbitrary resource sets and incorporates queries to ease control and post-processing. It was developed to run simulations of the price, control logic and energy layer of community controlled distributed assets in power systems and can easily be coupled with [OpenDSS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/electricdss/) to post hoc include power flow simulation.
