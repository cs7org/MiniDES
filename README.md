# MiniDES
The simulator MiniDES is a lightweight framework to run discrete simulations of resource objects in Python. It it allows for synchronized time progress on arbitrary resource sets and incorporates queries to ease control and post-processing. It was developed to run simulations of the price and energy layer of community controlled distributed assets in power systems and can easily be coupled with OpenDSS to post hoc include power flow simulation.
